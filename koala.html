			<h3>KOALA</h3>
			<p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a] (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.

Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
			
  <p> Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus.

Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. </p>
	<p>The koala is a stocky animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.[29][30] It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb),[30] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[31] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.[22] The species is sexually dimorphic, with males 50% larger than females. Males are further distinguished from females by their more curved noses[31] and the presence of chest glands, which are visible as hairless patches.[32] As in most marsupials, the male koala has a bifurcated penis,[33] and the female has two lateral vaginas and two separate uteri.[29] The male's penile sheath contains naturally occurring bacteria that play an important role in fertilisation.[34] The female's pouch opening is tightened by a sphincter that keeps the young from falling out.[35]

The pelage of the koala is thicker and longer on the back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside.[31] The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.[29] The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.[30] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.[36</p>
